Autonomous Research-Agent Plan

Project: Theoretical Limits of Low-Precision Adaptation in LLMs
Ultimate Deliverable: An arXiv-ready paper that (i) models how weight precision constrains fine-tuning capacity and (ii) validates the theory on a 361 M–1.3 B-parameter model at 16-, 8-, and 4-bit precision.

1  Goal & Success Criteria

Aspect	Definition of “Done”

Empirics	≤ 6 controlled LoRA runs (16/8/4-bit × 2 seeds) on DialoGPT-medium (or LLaMA-7B if resources allow) showing loss/perplexity trends that match theoretical predictions within ±10 %.
Narrative	6–8 page paper in LaTeX (arXiv format) with Introduction, Related Work, Theory, Experiments, Discussion, Conclusion, 1–2 figures, 1 key table.
Reproducibility	Git repo containing code, configs, logs, and a one-click script to reproduce main experiments.

3  Detailed Agent Instructions

A  Literature Scan
	1.	Query keywords: “quantization noise regularization”, “QLoRA theory”, “low-precision fine-tuning bounds”.
	2.	Select top 8–12 peer-reviewed or influential arXiv works (2020-2025).
	3.	Extract for each: citation, key equation or claim, relevance note (≤ 2 lines).
	4.	Store in lit_review.md.

B  Theory Drafting
	1.	Model each weight w as w_q = w + \epsilon where \epsilon ~ U(-\Delta/2,\Delta/2); \Delta ∝ 2^{-b}.
	2.	Derive expected increase in MSE loss and gradient variance after quantization.
	3.	Show how LoRA update \Delta W interacts with noise (assume small-rank matrices).
	4.	Produce a bound: E[\mathcal{L}{quant}] - \mathcal{L}{fp} \le C \cdot 2^{-2b}.
	5.	Export derivation as theory.pdf and LaTeX snippets.

C  Experiment Setup

Env: Python ≥ 3.10, PyTorch ≥ 2.1, transformers, peft, bitsandbytes.
	1.	setup.py installs deps, downloads DialoGPT-medium.
	2.	run_ft.py arguments: --bits {16,8,4} --seed {0,1}.
	3.	Log: eval loss, perplexity every epoch, gradient norms.

D  Empirical Runs
	1.	Execute six runs (3 precisions × 2 seeds).
	2.	Save metrics to results/metrics_{bits}_{seed}.json.
	3.	Track GPU/CPU‐hours in cost_log.md.

E  Analysis
	1.	analyze.py merges JSON logs into a pandas DF.
	2.	Plot curves and export .png → paper/figures/.
	3.	Validate theory: compute predicted vs observed loss gap; record correlation.

F  Draft Assembly
	1.	Start from paper/template.tex (arXiv).
	2.	Fill sections:
	•	Intro: context, gap, goal.
	•	Related Work: short lit review points.
	•	Theory: import LaTeX from theory.pdf.
	•	Experiments: dataset, model, training setup.
	•	Results: table + figures.
	•	Discussion: interpret why bound holds, future work (adaptive precision).
	3.	Auto-generate reference list via bibtex.

G  Polish & Submission Readiness
	1.	Run latexmk, ensure ≤ 15 MB PDF.
	2.	Check arXiv metadata compliance.
	3.	Final checklist in SUBMISSION.md.

4  How Much Research Is “Enough”?
	•	Theory depth: One main bound + short corollary on layer-wise sensitivity.
	•	Empirics: 3 precision settings, 2 seeds; extra runs only if theory–data mismatch > 10 %.
	•	Citations: 10–15 key references, not an exhaustive survey.
	•	Paper length: 6–8 pages main text, ≤ 10 with appendix.

5  Narrative Flow (for the Paper)
	1.	Hook (Intro): “Low-precision adapters make billion-scale LLMs trainable on laptops—but why does 4-bit still work?”
	2.	Gap: Empirical success ≠ theoretical understanding.
	3.	Contribution Statement: “We derive a bit-width–error bound and confirm it on DialoGPT.”
	4.	Method: Quantization noise model → bound.
	5.	Results: Table & figure show bound matches practice.
	6.	Implications: Practical rule-of-thumb; groundwork for adaptive precision.
	7.	Conclusion & Future: Combine bound with adaptive precision + rank for ultra-efficient tuning.
