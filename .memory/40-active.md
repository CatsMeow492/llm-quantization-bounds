# Current Focus & State

## Active Sprint / Cycle
**Sprint 0 â€“ Memory Bank Initialization & Literature Scan Preparation**

## Recent Changes
- Added `Goals.md` containing full project plan.
- Initialized `.memory` core files.

## Immediate Priorities (Ranked)
1. Conduct literature scan and create `lit_review.md`.
2. Draft theoretical derivation in notebook.
3. Scaffold experiment scripts (`setup.py`, `run_ft.py`).

## Open Questions
- Final model choice: DialoGPT-medium vs LLaMA-7B.
- Availability of GPUs for 4-bit experiments.

## Blockers
None at this stage.

## Recent Learnings
- Clear roadmap established; execution can proceed phase-by-phase.
