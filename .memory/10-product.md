# Product Definition

## Problem Statements
Low-precision adapters (e.g., 4-bit LoRA) empirically enable fine-tuning billion-parameter LLMs on modest hardware, yet theoretical understanding lags behind.

## User Personas
- ML researchers investigating efficient training.
- Practitioners seeking guidance on precision-performance trade-offs.

## User Journeys
1. Read the paper to understand theoretical limits.
2. Clone the repo, run the provided script, and reproduce results.
3. Apply insights to their own fine-tuning tasks.

## Feature Requirements
- Clear analytical bound and corollary.
- Reproducible experiments across precisions.
- Concise figures and table illustrating findings.

## UX Guidelines
- Paper should be self-contained and accessible to ML audiences.
- Repository README provides step-by-step instructions.

## User Metrics / KPIs
- Reproduction success rate â‰¥ 90 % (scripts run without error).
- Paper citation count (long-term).
- Community adoption of bound in subsequent research.
