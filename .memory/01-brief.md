# Project Charter: Theoretical Limits of Low-Precision Adaptation in LLMs

## Project Outline
Derive theoretical and empirical limits of adapting large language models (LLMs) with low-precision (16-, 8-, and 4-bit) weight representations.

## Core Requirements
- Analytical bound linking bit-width, quantization noise, gradient variance, and fine-tuning error.
- ≤ 6 controlled LoRA runs (16/8/4-bit × 2 seeds) on DialoGPT-medium (or LLaMA-7B if resources allow).
- Reproducible codebase and one-click script for experiments.
- 6–8 page arXiv-ready paper (LaTeX) with figures and table.

## Success Criteria
1. Bound validated by experiments within ±10 %.
2. Paper compiles without errors and meets arXiv constraints.
3. Repository contains code, configs, logs, and documentation.

## Stakeholders
- Research Lead (user)
- Autonomous Research Agent (this system)

## Constraints
- Limited compute budget (GPU hours).
- Timeline outlined in roadmap.
